title: "About me"
---

I am an applied micro-economist who studies health, management, productivity, and entrepreneurship.  
My work in low- and middle-income countries focuses on designing and evaluating interventions that increase the human capital of individuals and firms.  

In Mexico, my work relates to obesity and non-communicable diseases from the perspective of health services research and public policy.
