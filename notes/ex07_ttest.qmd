# The A/B Test

We have two groups from the "Pro-Futuro" program. 
* **Control:** Standard diet.
* **Treatment:** New nutrition program.

We want to know if the Treatment group has a significantly lower Body Mass Index (BMI).

```{webr-r}
# 1. Generate Data
n <- 200
control <- rnorm(n, mean = 28, sd = 4)
treatment <- rnorm(n, mean = 26.5, sd = 4) # Real effect of -1.5

df <- data.frame(
  BMI = c(control, treatment),
  Group = c(rep("Control", n), rep("Treatment", n))
)

# 2. Visual Check
boxplot(BMI ~ Group, data = df, col = c("orange", "lightgreen"), main = "BMI by Group")

# 3. Statistical Check (The T-Test)
t_test <- t.test(BMI ~ Group, data = df)

print(t_test)
cat("P-Value:", format.pval(t_test$p.value))
# Note: If p < 0.05, we have evidence of a statistically significant difference.
