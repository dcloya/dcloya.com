## Before We Begin

Before our first section, please make sure you have working and up-to-date installations of **R** and **RStudio**. We will use both extensively in this course, so it is definitely worth doing right.

---

## Installation

If you do not already have R and RStudio running on your computer, then you should install them both:

### Step 1: Install R

Download and install R from the official CRAN repository:

- **Windows**: [Download R for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
- **macOS**: [Download R for macOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
- **Linux**: [Download R for Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/)

### Step 2: Install RStudio

Download and install RStudio Desktop (free version):

- **All platforms**: [Download RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

::: {.callout-note}
**RStudio** is a super helpful IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for R—it's very helpful for both learning and using R.
:::

## Updating Existing Installations

If you already have R and RStudio on your computer, then you should make sure they are **up to date**:

- **Current R version**: 4.4.2 (2024-10-31) — *"Pile of Leaves"*
  - Check your version by typing `version` into the R console
  
- **Current RStudio version**: 2024.12.0 or newer
  - Check via: *Help → About RStudio*

::: {.callout-tip}
## Why update?
Newer versions include bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features that make your coding experience smoother.
:::

---

## Additional Tools (Recommended)

### LaTeX

I would recommend making sure you have a working installation of LaTeX for creating PDFs and mathematical typesetting:

- **Easy option**: Install TinyTeX via R:
  ```r
  install.packages("tinytex")
  tinytex::install_tinytex()
  ```

- **Full installation**: [Download MiKTeX (Windows)](https://miktex.org/) or [MacTeX (macOS)](https://www.tug.org/mactex/)

- **Online alternative**: [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) (no installation needed, includes LaTeX tutorials)

### Pandoc

Pandoc is usually included with RStudio, but you can verify by running in R:

```r
rmarkdown::pandoc_version()
```

If needed, download from: [pandoc.org](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)

---

## Does It Work?

Let's test your installation:

1. **Open RStudio**
2. In the console (bottom-left panel), type:
   ```r
   1 + 1
   ```
3. Press **Enter**

**Expected output:**
```r
[1] 2
```

::: {.callout-important}
If you get `[1] 2`, congratulations! Everything is working correctly. ✅

If not, try reinstalling R and RStudio, or ask for help.

## Resources for Learning R

I've compiled a large set of resources for R. You probably don't need them all right now, but know they are there. However, **the best resources for learning R are**:

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## Your Learning Toolkit

1. **Google** (which will probably lead you to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/))
2. **Time** (practice, practice, practice!)
3. **Your classmates** (collaborative learning works wonders)
4. **Me** (office hours, email, Slack/Teams)
:::

### Additional Resources

- [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund
- [RStudio Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
- [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/) - Interactive R tutorials
- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) - Free intro course
- [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) - Community blog posts

## Basic Suggestions for Success

### 1. Use R Scripts, Not Just the Console

::: {.callout-warning}
**Nearly everything you do should be in an R script**, as opposed to typing directly in the command line.
:::

**Why?**

- You can return to your code later
- You can edit and improve your work
- You need to turn in R scripts for assignments
- It's reproducible research!

**How to create a script:**

- File → New File → R Script (or `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + N`)

### 2. Comment Your Code

Good comments make your code understandable to others (and your future self):

```r
# Bad: No context
x <- 5
y <- x * 2

# Good: Clear explanation
price_per_unit <- 5           # Cost in dollars
total_cost <- price_per_unit * 2  # Two units purchased
```

### 3. Be Consistent with Naming Conventions

Pick a style and stick to it:

```r
# Camel Case (recommended for variables)
myVariableName <- 10
calculateTotalCost <- function(x) { x * 2 }

# Snake Case (also popular)
my_variable_name <- 10
calculate_total_cost <- function(x) { x * 2 }

# Choose ONE and be consistent!
```

::: {.callout-note}
**Avoid:**
- Starting variable names with numbers: `2021data` ❌
- Using reserved words: `if`, `for`, `function` ❌
- Spaces in names: `my variable` ❌
:::

### 4. Use Descriptive File Names

Be smart when naming files and folders:

**Bad names:**
```
cbn18319ddg890-7a.csv
untitled1.R
data.xlsx
final_FINAL_v2_REALFINAL.R
```

**Good names:**
```
CensusCountyDemographics.csv
01_DataCleaning.R
HouseholdIncomeSurvey_2024.xlsx
AnalyzeTaxReliefProgram.R
```

**Two good naming conventions:**

1. **Camel Case**: `WhatAGreatFileName.csv`
2. **Snake Case**: `what_a_great_file_name.csv`

::: {.callout-tip}
## Pro Tips
- Add dates in YYYY-MM-DD format: `2024-01-15_Analysis.R`
- Number files to show order: `01_Import.R`, `02_Clean.R`, `03_Analyze.R`
- Use descriptive prefixes: `fig_`, `tab_`, `data_`
:::

### 5. Organize Your Files and Use Smart Paths

Make your life easier by:

**Organizing into folders:**
```
MyProject/
  ├── Data/
  │   ├── Raw/
  │   └── Processed/
  ├── Scripts/
  ├── Output/
  │   ├── Figures/
  │   └── Tables/
  └── README.md
```

**Using `paste0()` or `paste()` for file paths:**

```r
# Instead of typing full paths every time:
data <- read.csv("/Users/david/Documents/Project/Data/census.csv")

# Use paste0() for flexibility:
project_path <- "/Users/david/Documents/Project"
data_path <- paste0(project_path, "/Data/census.csv")
data <- read.csv(data_path)

# Even better: use relative paths with here package
library(here)
data <- read.csv(here("Data", "census.csv"))
```

::: {.callout-note}
We'll see more examples of smart file organization and path management in **Section 1**.
