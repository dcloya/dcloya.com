# Returns to Education

We plot **Years of Schooling** (X) vs. **Hourly Wage** (Y). The slope of the blue line tells us the monetary value of one extra year of education.

```{webr-r}
# 1. Generate Data
n <- 100
schooling <- runif(n, 0, 20) # 0 to 20 years of school
# Wage = 100 base + 50 per year of school + noise
wage <- 100 + (50 * schooling) + rnorm(n, 0, 150) 

# 2. Run Regression
model <- lm(wage ~ schooling)

# 3. Plot
plot(schooling, wage, pch = 16, col = "gray", 
     xlab = "Years of Schooling", ylab = "Hourly Wage ($MXN)")
abline(model, col = "blue", lwd = 3)

# 4. View Results
cat("Base Wage (Intercept): $", round(coef(model)[1], 2), "\n")
cat("Value of 1 Year of School (Slope): $", round(coef(model)[2], 2))
