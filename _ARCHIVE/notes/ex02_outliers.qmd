# Spot the Data Error

Real government data is messy. In this dataset of 6th-grade student heights, a data entry error has occurred (using "999" for missing data). 

**Task:** Identify the outlier that is destroying the average and filter it out.

```{webr-r}
# 1. Create a dataset with a data entry error
# Normal kids are around 145cm
heights <- rnorm(100, mean = 145, sd = 10) 
# The error code (or a typo) added to the data
heights <- c(heights, 999) 

# 2. Visualize the problem
hist(heights, main = "Histogram with Outlier", col = "#ff6b6b", breaks = 20)

# 3. YOUR TURN: Filter the data
# We only want heights below 200cm
clean_heights <- heights[heights < 200]

# 4. Check the "clean" average vs the "dirty" average
cat("Average (Dirty):", round(mean(heights), 2), "cm\n")
cat("Average (Clean):", round(mean(clean_heights), 2), "cm")
```
